# Car Rent

## Description

Car Rent is a web application designed for renting cars. Users can select from a variety of car options, review their specifications, read customer reviews, and submit a form to rent a car by specifying pickup and drop-off dates, along with their email, name, and car model. This project showcases a basic implementation with both frontend and backend components, which can be expanded with additional features.
